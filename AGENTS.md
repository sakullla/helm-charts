# Repository Guidelines

This repository hosts the **`gh-pages`** branch for the Helm charts site. It contains published artifacts and a static web UI, not chart source code.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `index.html`: Static UI for browsing charts; includes inline CSS and JavaScript.
- `index.yaml`: Helm repository index generated by CI/CD. Do not edit by hand.
- `charts/`: Published chart archives (`.tgz`) organized by chart name.
- `.github/workflows/`: Maintenance automation (e.g., manual cleanup for `index.yaml`).

Chart source code and development docs live on the `main` branch.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

There is no build step for this branch. For local preview:

- `python -m http.server 8000` — serve the repo locally, then open `http://localhost:8000`.
- `npx serve .` — alternative static file server.

Avoid editing `index.yaml` and `charts/`; these are generated by release workflows.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Use 4-space indentation in `index.html` for HTML, CSS, and JS blocks.
- Keep CSS variables in the `:root` section; prefer reusing existing tokens.
- Keep CDN versions explicit and update consistently in one change.
- Use clear, descriptive IDs/classes for UI elements (e.g., `chart-grid`, `search-input`).

## Testing Guidelines

No automated tests in this branch. Validate changes by:

- Opening the page locally and checking for console errors.
- Verifying the chart list renders from `index.yaml`.
- Checking responsive layout on desktop and mobile widths.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history follows conventional commits (`feat:`, `perf:`, `chore:`) alongside occasional `Update index.yaml`. Recommended:

- Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, or `chore:` prefixes.
- Include `[skip ci]` only for automated or maintenance-only updates.
- For UI changes, include screenshots or a short GIF in the PR description.
- Do not commit chart source code or manually edit `index.yaml`.

## Branch & Artifact Notes

This branch contains published artifacts. For chart development, switch to `main` and follow its repository guidelines and CI workflows.
